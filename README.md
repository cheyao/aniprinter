# The Aniprinter

The ani* series printer! The custom aniprinter!

Are you restricted by your bed size, but don't have a lot of money to upgrade? This printer is for you! (No cap :3)

Aniprinter is cheap and big! You get a 310x310mm bed with only 150$!

(Yes, I know I used the full 300$ grant, but that's because I had to take shipping by air >.<)

This printer will have removable cat ears with magnets!

It uses a 300W PSU. Be carful not to get shocked.

The nozzle design is optimized for maximal airflow.
